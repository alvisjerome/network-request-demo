## Network Request Demo

This is a basic flutter application which demonstrate how you can handle a network request and it's different states. I have used a [fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) which provide us a list of users.

For the implementation you need to have a library for making HTTP request. I'm using [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) but you can use [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) or any other library as well.
